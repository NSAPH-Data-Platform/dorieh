## Introduction

[Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)](https://www.cms.gov/) 
provide 
[Medicaid Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) data](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Computer-Data-and-Systems/MedicaidDataSourcesGenInfo/MAXGeneralInformation). 
The MAX data is export from 
[SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/stat.html) 
to CSV format, similar to Excel in its semantic. 
We refer to the original MAX data as RAW data.

The pipeline steps are being put into a framework and wrapped
as CWL workflows.
                                
## Importing raw data   
                                       
### Parsing FTS files to generate schema
**Pipeline step**: [parse_fts](pipeline/parse_fts.md)

The first step is to parse File transfer summary (FTS)
included with the data and generate YAML schema for
raw data. 

File transfer summary (FTS) document contains information about 
the data extract. These are plain text files containing
information such as the number of
columns in the data extract, number of rows and the size of the
data file. The FTS document provides the
starting positions, the length and the generic format of 
each of the column (such as character, numeric or date)  

Parsing FTS is done by running module 
[create_schema_config](members/create_schema_config.rst).
                                                       
    pyhton -m dorieh.platform.dorieh.cms.create_schema_config

Once the schema is generated, the 
[Universal Data Loader](members/data_loader) can import it
by running the following command:

    nohup python -u -m dorieh.platform.loader.data_loader --domain cms -t ps --domain cms --incremental --data /data/incoming/rce/ci3_d_medicaid/original_data/cms_medicaid-max/data/  -t ps --pattern "**/maxdata_*_ps_*.csv*"  --threads 4 --page 1000 --log 100000 2>&1 > ps-2021-09-25--21-37.log&

## Processing data

## Data Model

The resulting data model for Medicaid domain is defined by 
[medicaid.yaml](members/medicaid_yaml.md)

Four main tables are used to fulfill user requests:

    |--- beneficiaries
        |--- enrollments
            |--- eligibility
                |--- admissions

An additional table `monthly` is only used to generate the tables above
and is not exposed to users. CMS raw data contains
a column for each month and type of data thus producing
hundreds of columns. Monthly table transposes these columns
to create separate records (rows) for each month. One can say it 
converts columns to rows, hence we are calling it transposition.

All tables above are physically represented as 
[views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_(SQL)) 
inside the database. 
One can think about views as virtual or computed tables. 
For efficiency these views can be materialized 
([materialized view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view) 
is a database world term). If a view is materialized, PostgreSQL
allows building indices on its columns. After indices are built 
most queries can be executed interactively even on vast 
amounts of data.

Creation of non-materialized views is instantaneous operation. 
Technically, it allows performing the same type of queries
as with materialized views or physical tables, but many
(but not all) quiries can be very slow and take hours.

Materializing a view and building indices takes time, 
often hours but is much faster than importing raw data. 


### Beneficiaries
**Pipeline step**: [ingest](pipeline/ingest)

See also [creating Medicare Beneficiaries table](Medicare.md#creating-beneficiaries-table)

#### BENE_ID column

Beneficiaries table is based on BENE_ID column in the raw data.
The [BENE_ID](https://resdac.org/cms-data/variables/encrypted-723-ccw-beneficiary-id) 
is a unique beneficiary identifier encrypted 
specifically to the researcher/Data Use Agreement (DUA). 
This identifier is unique to the Chronic Condition 
Data Warehouse (CCW) and protects the identity of the 
Medicaid and/or Medicare beneficiary.

However, BENE_ID are unreliable. About 7% of records are missing 
BENE_ID. There are records with conflicting information such
as different dates of birth, dates of death, sex and ethnicity
that have the same BENE_ID. Sometimes the date of birth differ 
by 80 (eighty) years.

[Official documentation](https://www2.ccwdata.org/documents/10280/19002246/ccw-max-user-guide.pdf)
states in the section _Assignment of a Beneficiary Identifier_:

>To construct the CCW BENE_ID, the CMS CCW team developed an internal cross-reference file
consisting of historical Medicaid and Medicare enrollment information using CMS data sources
such as the Enterprise Cross Reference (ECR) file. When a new MAX PS file is received, the
MSIS_ID, STATE_CD, SSN, DOB, Gender and other beneficiary identifying information is compared
against the historical enrollment file. If there is a single record in the historical enrollment file
that “best matches” the information in the MAX PS record, then the BENE_ID on that historical
record is assigned to the MAX PS record. If there is no match or no “best match” after CCW has
exhausted a stringent matching process, a null (or missing) BENE_ID is assigned to the MAX PS
record. For any given year, approximately 7% to 8% of MAX PS records have a BENE_ID that is
null. Once a BENE_ID is assigned to a MAX PS record for a particular year (with the exception of
those assigned to a null value), it will not change. When a new MAX PS file is received, CCW
attempts to reassign those with missing BENE_IDs.
    
#### Deduplication and data cleansing

As discussed above, about 7% of patient summary records are missing
`BENE_ID` column and thus are excluded from `Beneficiaries` and all
subsequent tables, containing processed data.

Also, as we have discussed, sometimes data for beneficiary is 
inconsistent. Specifically, there are records that have the same 
`BENE_ID` but different dates of birth and/or dates of death.

We combine all records with the same `BENE_ID` into a single record in 
the `Beneficiaries` table, using `GROUP BY` SQL clause.
When there are inconsistent raw data for a given `BENE_ID`,
we apply the following rules:

* A record is clearly marked as containing duplicates.
  a column `duplicates` contains the number of 
  inconsistencies using the following specification:

        source: "COUNT(distinct {identifiers})"
  where `{identifiers}` refers to a list of columns marked
  as identifiers, in our case:
    * dob 
    * dod (date of death)
    * race_ethnicity_code
    * sex
* Identifier columns for the combined record are filled
  by applying the following rules:
    * dob: the earliest raw DOB 
    * dod (date of death): the latest raw DOD
    * race_ethnicity_code: comma separated list of codes
    * sex: comm separated list of sexes
* Additional columns are added to the record:
    * dob_latest: the latest raw DOB
    * dod_earliest: the earliest raw DOD
                                        
This allows a project curator to apply various rules to include or exclude 
records where data for beneficiaries is inconsistent. For example,
the curator can:

* Exclude all inconsistent records
* Exclude records with inconsistent dates of death (legacy strategy)
* Exclude records where difference between dates of birth 
  is more than 3 years
* etc.

We can establish actual rules for NSAPH projects later at a SOP level.

> this data.

### Enrollments                             
                          
See also [Medicare Enrollments](Medicare.md#creating-enrollments-table) table.

`Enrollments` table summarizes enrollments of
beneficiaries in medicaid in specific states 
during specific years. From technical point of view
it is an SQL view comprising collection
of raw records grouped by:

* `BENE_ID`
* Year
* State

Additional columns added to the view for convenience:

* state_iso: ISO code of the state, used for mapping
* residence_county: one of the "latest" residence 
  counties where 
  the beneficiary was registered, latest in 
  alphabetical order
* residence_counties: comma separated list of all 
  "latest" residence counties, where a beneficiary was
  registered during the year
* fips5: 5 digit FIPS code of the `residence_county`
* zip: one of the "latest" zip codes where 
  the beneficiary was registered, latest in 
  numerical order
* zips: comma separated list of all 
  "latest" zip codes, where a beneficiary was
  registered during the year
* months_eligible: a number of months in the year the
  beneficiary was eligible for medicaid
* months_dual_eligible: a number of months in 
  the year the beneficiary was eligible for 
  both medicaid and medicare
* state_count: number of states, where the beneficiary
  was enrolled in medicaid during the year. Note,
  this is also the number of records for this beneficiary and this year
  in the Enrollments` table.
* died: a boolean flag indicating that the beneficiary has 
  died during this year while being registered
  for medicaid in this state.
                                                    
Quoted "latest" points to the fact that multiple
"latest" counties or zip codes signal data inconsistency
rather than a simple fact that a beneficiary could have
moved during the year.                          

### Eligibility

This is in fact a monthly detalization of beneficiaries
enrollments in medicaid. 
                                                   
### Inpatient Admissions

Table with all inpatient admissions billed to Medicaid with 
admission and discharge dates and ICD codes.
