# File Transfer Summary

File transfer summary (FTS) document contains information about 
the data extract. These are plain text files containing
information such as the number of
columns in the data extract, number of rows and the size of the
data file. The FTS document provides the
starting positions, the length and the generic format of 
each of the column (such as character, numeric or date)

These files are often generated by export from [SAS](https://www.sas.com/)

ResDac are accompanied by FTS files describing the data file structure.
